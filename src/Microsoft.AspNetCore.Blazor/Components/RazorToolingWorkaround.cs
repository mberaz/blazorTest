/*
 * Currently if you have a .cshtml file in a project with <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">,
 * Visual Studio will run design-time builds for the .cshtml file that assume certain ASP.NET MVC
 * APIs exist. Since those namespaces and types wouldn't normally exist for Blazor client apps,
 * this leads to spurious errors in the Errors List pane, even though there aren't actually any
 * errors on build. As a workaround, we define here a minimal set of namespaces/types that satisfy
 * the design-time build.
 * 
 * TODO: Track down what is triggering the unwanted design-time build and find out how to disable it.
 * Then this file can be removed entirely.
